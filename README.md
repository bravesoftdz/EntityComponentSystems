# Entity Component Systems: A Different Approach to Coding

Example source code accompanying the DelphiCon 2021 session "[Entity Component Systems: A Different Approach to Coding](https://delphicon.embarcadero.com/talks/entity-component-systems-a-different-approach-to-coding)"

This directory contains 2 implementations:
* The "Pure" subdirectory contains a simple Entity Component Systems (ECS) implementation that tries to stay as pure to the ECS model as possible.
* The "OOP-Like" subdirectory contains the same version, but adds some OOP-like helpers making entities behave more like Delphi objects.

Both versions are functionally the same.
